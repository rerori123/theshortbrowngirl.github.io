#The black hole.#

No, I'm not thinking about The Blackhole. The region existing in space that exhibits a strong gravitational force that can pull literally anything inside it, trapping it and making it impossible for it to escape; including light. Nope, not that. Well, figuratively yes. 

I'm talking about the evil and the vicious circle of the internet. The one where every single person today is being pulled or already has been sucked in. Be it a senior citizen, a middle-aged person or a teen; everyone has their head and mind dissolved inside their devices. I'm not going to bore you about the disadvantages or the health problems you will be facing in a few years, which you will anyway be eventually facing. #beingabsolutelystraightfoward. * Addiction to #hashtags are a real struggle * 

  # lifestruggles #tryingtobepositive #idontreallyknowwhatimdoing There, now I am content.

 My question for the day is why are we so interested in knowing other's lives through the internet while we can interact with each other right being next to each other? People don't update their messy, unorganized lives on any of their social media. We see their fake, perfect lives and get intimidated by that. How many of you actually enjoyed a day with your friends and never took a selfie? Not having the need to update it somewhere? Even I'm at fault. I am not defending myself but things gotta change around sometime right?

Being one of the victims who got sucked in a few years back, I have always found scrolling aimlessly through www.instagram.com or www.facebook.com for hours. * slyly inserting links to social media to check out my accounts.*  I very well know that I have college at 9 in the morning and probably have to sleep by 12 to get at least 8 hours of beauty sleep, but what does my mind tell me to do? *Check Instagram, check Snapchat, scroll through your feed which has already given a notification that it has refreshed the maximum. And I finally end up looking at how to survive in the Mount Everest if you ever got stuck, on Youtube. :3 

I admit that the Internet has brought tremendous changes in our lives, but what if we are also changing along with that? 

I wouldn't tell or advice anyone to give up their phones or completely stop using them. Neither can you nor can I. :P But we can always start, right? 

P.S: Note to all those who post amazing, angled and most necessary snaps of their restaurant only food every single day, a thought to all of you guys; Don't drop your phone in the food. That would be drastic.
