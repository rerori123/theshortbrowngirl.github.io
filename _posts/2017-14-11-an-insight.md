# An insight.#

Reaching out to all the four eyed amigos out there. Let's bond for a minute over here.

Searching for the glasses you kept the previous night and apparently forgot about it and now you realize that you need your glasses to find your glasses? :3 Been there.

Cashing out tons of money, replacing that broken glasses while your dad mutters angrily under his breath on how careless you have been? Been there too. 

Been in a 3D movie and quite half the movie you try to find the perfect alignment for your glasses and the 3D glasses? Been there so many times. 

The day is perfect. Sunshine beaming. Your mascara is on point so is your eyeliner. And now, try taking a selfie with your glasses on? *An announced* ray of sunlight reflects on your glasses that it could actually burn a paper and you could teach a group of 6th graders about it.

Sunglasses? NAHHHH. More like everyday glasses to let you see the world better. Way better than saying you're half blind. 

And, have you ever been in a situation where you need to clean your glasses but unfortunately your shirt isn't the right material. Haha. FML. 

Yeah, sure. Wearing contacts could be the perfect option for me, you would say? But unfortunately there is no such market selling contacts for *lazy asses who cant keep their stuff organized.*  

I have been wearing glasses for a long time. A very long time. So long, that I address it as my soul best friend. ;-;

*Anyways, a cheers to a long eternity of wearing glasses. And to all those out there, I feel you.*
