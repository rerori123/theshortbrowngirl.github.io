Hello from the hectic world of stitching and draping. 

One year has passed and I have finally entered my parent department, Fashion Design. Things have changed. Timetable, teachers, friends (more or less) and so did my hostel room which has been "conveniently" upgraded to the 3rd floor from the 1st floor. :3 That's 60 steps every day. Up and down. Over and over again, carrying a ton of materials in our hands. 

A typical day in my life starts in the morning at 7:58, when I wake up and realize that I am awake, two minutes before the alarm. Convincing myself that I gotta wake up and get on with the day, I unwillingly and hesitantly break up with my bed for the next 8 hours. 

After seeing all the sleepy faces of my friends and giving a hand gesture, too lazy to talk, I finally finish brushing and all other stuff. 

Dressing up; Let me talk about that for a while. It is one hell of a headache. Finding the T-shirt which matches the jeans or finding the accessory which goes along with the dress is like finding *x* in an equation. But the latter is more tough. xD Yet, I manage to wing the eyeliner, put on lipstick, and tie my hair into a messy bun. Then, with 10 minutes to spare I run to have my breakfast and off to college to which we have to climb the 7 floors cause half the times the lifts are filled because everyone wants to reach their classes. :3

If the day's timetable starts with a theory subject, then yay! It's sleep time! :P If not, then that involves standing and working in the lab which is basically like a morning workout for us. The day ends for us at either 4 or 5:30 P.M. Whichever that is, I will be drained of all possible energy that I could posses. After I reach back to my hostel, I realize that I look like a person who just survived the hurricane. My so-called winged eyeliner looks so smudged that I can barely find my eyes and my hair looks like birds attacked it. :3 After refreshing, I decide to take a power nap for 30 mins which ends into a deep slumber from which the prince has to wake up the princess. Well, in my case my roomate is my prince. xP Realizing I wasted a shit load of time, I drag myself to have dinner. Depending on the work I have to take to college next day, I either go finish that which takes up almost the entire night ;-; or do something extremely useless. :P I do something productive or laze around, it's either one of that. There's no middle ground. xP 

The day ends by me getting back with my bed even knowing that I will have to part with it the next morning. ;-;. 

Anyways, looking foward to the weekend. I bid farewell, folks. Adieu.
