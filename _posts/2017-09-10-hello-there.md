### Hello there. 
I'm a 18 year old girl who is barely surviving and scraping through life. I study in NIFT ( National Institute of Fashion Technology ) at the Kannur branch. Yup, the one in Kerala for those who didn't know. I started off my schooling in Sharjah. I did my kindergarten and first few school years there. Won't be telling much about that cause I barely remember anything about that phase xD Then my family and I came all the the way to Kerala. I studied an year there and then finally and permanently moved to Chennai. The one place I call home, even though I'm a Malayali. As though I remember life, I have always spent my life here. I live with my parents and my annoying little brother ( just kidding, he's awesome. ‚ù§ ). But as for now, Im 600 miles apart from them. :| But thats cool, they are free of me running around the home like a maniac for like two months. xD 

So I did my schooling in exactly three schools: Spartan (the cool one), Velammal (the extra strict one), Chennai Public School (back to the cool one). So I have experienced both the extremes of schools. I  don't give any less importance to any one of them, all three of them has given me amazing and important lessons in life which I swore I would never forget but ended did up doing the same. Of course, who am I kidding? xD Calculus and algebra and integration and shiz? God, no. I don't know how people just breeze their way through these chapters. I still race back time, thinking about how many times I sat in front of the huge, math books from which I never understood a single word. Tuition after tuitions just made the teacher give up on me. But yay, I successfully graduated!! Trust me, my parents were equally shocked. xD 

Be it Math, Physics or Chemistry my passion has always been off these subjects. I have always had the love and the knack for fashion designing. I have been designing since my 6th grade. Yup, that's how i ended up in NIFT. 

I consider myself an ambivert. Being in my own comfort zone with my tiny set of friends brings me a sack of happiness, yet I love to interact with people outside my ring of friends. I love to start and bring the fun out in a group. My friends call me the crazy one, but let's chuck that out. xD 

Currently being 18, and having staring school early, I have been the ‚Äúlittle‚Äù one to all my classmates and friends. An year back, when everyone turned 18,  getting their license, going to clubs, I sat there rethinking whether I should book tickets for that 18+ movie having an anxiety attack of being caught and denied entry. :3 That didn't stop me from sneaking in. :P

Anyways, at the moment, being in the second year of fashion design, I wouldn't say I miss my childhood cause I'm still living it. YES. Call me crazy but I love being a child at heart. ( sometimes at mind too. üòõ )  When I'm outta it, it will be a new day for me to begin, till then signing off. :)
