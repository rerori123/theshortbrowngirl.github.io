Nift exam?

For all those who is pursuing their career in NIFT, reading the line above will give mixed emotions. For all those who aren't, many would most likely be like *NIFT exams? tsk tsk It's just an interview kinda thing right? Must be very easy.* Well, thats what I too thought when I started off here. 

Let me just debrief here. In simple words. 

Exams in NIFT are called Juries. A platform where there are three professors judging and marking all your works that you have done that particular semester and your life for the next few hours lies in their hands. 

This semester's first jury was on *4th December 2017*. 

Let's rewind time a little. 

**3rd December 2017**

*17:00* Contemplating how many works I have to finish and how many works I should *mount*. Mounting is a word that Niftians hate and is apparently a way to make our works look better and costs a lot of money too.  Hella lot.

*18:00* Working. 

*19:00* Still Working.

*21:00* Go to your neighboring rooms in the hostel and check up on how much they have finished and sit there and try to figure on who the jury members will be for the next day and waste one hour. 

*23:00* Decide to work again. 

*00:00* Still working.

*01:00* Fall asleep on your works until your roommate screams and wakes you up. 

*02:00* Finally give up on life and go to sleep. 

*08:00*  Manange to wake up to the repeated yelling of the alarm and get dressed in formals and calm yourself that the excruciating pain of your heels will be less than the amount of anxiety attack you are going to go through. 

*09:00* Hall tickets are given and the first person was called in for the jury. 

*09:30* She hasnt come out yet. Is she screwed? Am I? OMG. I AM GOING TO FAIL THIS SEMESTER. Will it be easy? Is the jury members in a good mood? Will they like my works? What if they won't?

*10:00* Still panicking.

*11:00* Still panicking. Freaking out. *Does anyone have water? Why? So I can drown my fears in it.*

*11:30* You hear your name called upon, *internal screaming*, trying to tell yourself that its your turn now. 

Walk into the room. Show your manners. Display your works. Start explaining. Get interrupted. Get asked a question. Mind goes blank. Stutter. Stammer. Still tried to explain. Gets yelled at. Managed to maintain a straight face. Still stuggling to get atleast one answer right. End. Get asked to leave the room and send in the next person. 

*12:30* Walks out. Confused. Gets surrounded by your anxious classmates who start bombarding you with their queries about what went on inside the Jury hall. You tell them the questions the jury panel asked knowing that they are never going to be asked again. 

*12:45* Will I pass? Will I have to redo the semester all over again? I CAN'T DO THAT.

*13:00* Mom's call. Dad's call. **It was fine.** being the answer to their questions. 

*14:00* "Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong", *Murphy's Law*. But I need sleep. Good Night. 

*17:00* Work. Eat. Repeat. For the next 10 more juries. 

Dealing with everything and sucking it up for just a few days of holidays that come after these exams, Which I am apparently doing right now. ^.^

Happy holidays, fellas!

And,

Have an amazing New Year, just till we get to the monotonous routine. :))))
